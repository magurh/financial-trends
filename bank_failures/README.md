# US Bank Failures: Are we close to a new banking crisis?


There’ve been much news lately (spring 2023) regarding US regional banks, which have been under heavy pressure since Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed in early March. This was followed by the failures of Signature Bank and then First Republic Bank on May 1st, which led many people to think that this might just be tip of the iceberg. 📉

So, I was wondering whether bank failures have been somewhat common in recent history or not at all. The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) has records dating back to 1934 of all the US failed banks that have been federally insured. Note that some of the largest failed banks around the 2008 crisis, like Lehman Brothers ($600 billion in assets) or Bear Sterns ($350 billion), are not included since they were not federally insured. 📚

The results are plotted below and show three waves: the Great Depression, the Banking Crises of the 1980s and Early 1990s and the 2008 financial crisis. So, with only 3 failed banks in 2023, perhaps we are not in any danger as of now. However, what is slightly alarming is the size of these failed banks. The largest FDIC insured bank in US history that closed down is the Washington Mutual, which had assets above $300 billions in 2008, before its collapse. Accounting for inflation, this would translate to around $420 billion in 2023. 🏦

Meanwhile, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank had assets valued at $209, $118 and $229 billion, respectively, making them some of the largest failed banks in US history, even after inflation adjustments! This surely generated some panic among the customers of smaller US regional banks, with the stock prices of Pacific Western Bank ($40 billion in assets) or Western Alliance Bank ($70 billion in assets) falling by more than 40% in a single day earlier this month. As the reddit user bigbear0083 puts it, for smaller banks, the fear is that their profitability has reduced as they have to increase the interest rates they pay depositors to keep them from fleeing. 💸

What do you think? Will we see more banks closing their doors in the near future or will they find a way to redress this trend?
