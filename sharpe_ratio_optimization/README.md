# Sharpe Ratio Optimization

The attached jupyter notebook is an example of portfolio building based on maximization of the Sharpe Ratio. We take the largest contributors to the S&P 500 index, whose weights are purely based on market capitalization.

We then find a portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio of a combination of these stocks, and compare it with the S&P index.
